# 04 - Transferring data

This guide explains exactly what the tool copies, how each Redis type becomes a
native Aerospike type, how TTLs and large records are handled, and what happens
when you run it more than once.

## How the transfer works

```
Redis ──SCAN+pipeline──> Producer ──> bounded queue ──> Worker 1..N ──> Aerospike
                                                            │
                                              convert -> (transform) -> write
```

1. A single producer streams keys out of Redis using `SCAN` (cursor-based, so it
   never blocks the server) and pipelines the value/TTL reads.
2. Records land on a bounded in-memory queue that provides back-pressure -- a
   fast Redis read can't outrun Aerospike writes and exhaust memory.
3. A pool of worker threads pulls records off the queue, converts each value to a
   native Aerospike type, and writes it.

Each record is processed independently. If one record fails to convert or write,
it is counted and the migration keeps going.

## Type mapping

| Redis type | Aerospike representation |
| --- | --- |
| **String** | A single bin, coerced in order: `int` -> `float` -> `str` -> `bytes` (blob). The first type that fits is used. |
| **Hash** | One Map bin by default, or one bin per field with `--hash-strategy field_bins`. |
| **List** | An Aerospike List, with order preserved. |
| **Set** | An Aerospike List written with the `ADD_UNIQUE` flag (ordered), so set semantics are enforced server-side. |
| **Sorted set** | An Aerospike Map of `{member: score}`. |

The Aerospike record identity is ``(namespace, set, primary_key)``. UTF-8 keys
are stored as strings; binary keys are preserved as-is. With **set routes**,
``set`` comes from the matched route and ``primary_key`` is usually the part of
the Redis key that matched the single ``*`` in the pattern (see below); keys
that do not match any route keep the full Redis key and the default set.

### Redis source filter vs Aerospike set routing

These are **orthogonal** controls:

| Control | Config / CLI | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Source filter** (less data from Redis) | YAML `redis.scan_match` (alias `key_pattern` if `scan_match` is omitted), CLI `--redis-match` or `--redis-key-pattern` | Passed to Redis `SCAN` as `MATCH`. Only keys matching this glob enter the pipeline, which reduces SCAN results and follow-up reads. |
| **Set routes** (Aerospike placement + key) | YAML `aerospike.set_routes`, CLI `--set-route PATTERN=SET` (repeatable) | After a key is read, the first matching route picks the **Aerospike set** and rewrites the **primary key** by dropping the fixed literal parts of the pattern around a single ``*`` (see below). Keys that match none use ``aerospike.set_name`` / ``--aerospike-set`` and the full Redis key. Does **not** run an extra Redis SCAN. |

`scan_match` defines the **superset** of keys for this run. Set routes only apply to keys already returned by SCAN.

**Set route semantics:** routes are ordered; **first match wins**. Patterns use Python [`fnmatch`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) (glob-style), evaluated on UTF-8 string keys. **Binary Redis keys** always use the default set (`set_name`) and the full Redis key, not route patterns.

**Primary key when a route matches:** if the route pattern contains **exactly one** ``*`` and no ``?`` or ``[`` characters, the substring that aligns with that ``*`` becomes the Aerospike user key—the literal segments before and after ``*`` are removed. Examples: pattern ``user:*`` with Redis key ``user:42`` → Aerospike key ``42`` in the routed set; ``app:*:item`` with ``app:7:item`` → ``7``. If stripping would yield an empty string, the full Redis key is kept. Patterns with **multiple** ``*``, ``?``, or ``[`` still match for routing and set choice, but the primary key is left **unchanged** (full Redis key).

**SCAN limitation:** Redis applies **one** `MATCH` pattern per scan. There is no built-in OR of unrelated globs (e.g. `user:*` and `cache:*`) in a single pass. Prefer one broader glob (e.g. `app:*`) or run separate migrations with different `scan_match` values if you need disjoint prefixes.

### String coercion, by example

| Redis string value | Stored in Aerospike as |
| --- | --- |
| `"42"` | integer `42` |
| `"3.14"` | float `3.14` |
| `"hello"` | string `"hello"` |
| arbitrary binary bytes | a blob |

### Hash strategies

`--hash-strategy` (YAML `hash_strategy`, env `MIGRATION_HASH_STRATEGY`) chooses
how a Redis hash is represented:

- **`map_bin`** (default): the entire hash is stored as a single Aerospike Map in
  the value bin. Simplest, 1:1 mapping.
- **`field_bins`**: each hash field becomes its own Aerospike bin. More "native"
  and queryable per field, but subject to Aerospike's bin-name length limits and
  per-record bin count.

```bash
redis-to-aerospike --redis-host localhost \
  --aerospike-host localhost --aerospike-namespace test --aerospike-set redis \
  --hash-strategy field_bins
```

## TTL handling

Redis TTLs (in milliseconds) are converted to Aerospike TTLs (in seconds). Keys
with no expiry are written as **never-expire**.

### The max-TTL boundary

Aerospike caps a record's TTL at the namespace `max-ttl` (10 years by default).
The tool enforces a boundary before writing:

- `--max-ttl` (YAML `max_ttl`, env `AEROSPIKE_MAX_TTL`): the limit in **seconds**.
  Default is 10 years (`315360000`). Set to `0` to disable the check entirely.
- `--ttl-overflow-policy` (YAML `ttl_overflow_policy`, env
  `MIGRATION_TTL_OVERFLOW_POLICY`): what to do with a record whose TTL exceeds
  `--max-ttl`:

| Policy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `reject` (default) | The record is rejected **before** any write and counted as a `convert:TtlTooLongError` error. |
| `clamp` | Stored with exactly `max-ttl`. A single warning is logged per run. |
| `never_expire` | Stored as never-expire. A single warning is logged per run. |

### Will the server actually expire TTLs?

If the target namespace has `nsup-period=0`, **TTL eviction is disabled** and any
TTLs you write will never be enforced by the server. The tool detects this on
connect and logs a clear warning. See
[Troubleshooting](06-troubleshooting.md#ttls-are-not-being-expired).

## Choosing which keys to migrate

By default every key is migrated. To migrate a subset, use the Redis match
pattern (`--redis-match`, see [Connecting to Redis](02-connecting-redis.md#selecting-which-keys-to-migrate)).

This also affects the **key estimate** shown in the pre-run preview:

- With `--redis-match *`, the estimate is the exact key count (`DBSIZE`).
- With any other pattern, the preview shows `<= <DBSIZE>` -- the whole-database
  count as an upper bound, since the matching subset isn't known until the scan
  runs.

## Large records

Aerospike rejects records above a maximum object size (8 MiB by default). To give
you a clear, actionable error instead of a mid-write server failure, the tool
estimates each record's size and rejects oversized ones up front with a
`write:RecordTooLargeError`.

On connect, the tool reads the server's advertised `max-record-size` and aligns
its own guard with that real limit (instead of the built-in 8 MiB default), so
the check matches your cluster's actual configuration.

## Running it more than once (idempotency)

Re-running a migration is safe:

- Regular records are written with `put`, so a second run simply overwrites them
  with the same values.
- **Set** bins use `ADD_UNIQUE` with the `NO_FAIL` and `PARTIAL` flags, so
  re-adding members that already exist is silently skipped rather than failing
  the write.

This means an interrupted migration can be re-run from the start without
producing duplicates or errors from already-migrated data.

## Types that are skipped

Only String, Hash, List, Set, and Sorted Set are supported. Other types (for
example, Redis **Streams**) are **skipped** and counted under "skipped by type"
in the summary, keyed by the Redis type name. The migration does not fail
because of them.
