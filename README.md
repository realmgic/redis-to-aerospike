# Redis to Aerospike Migrator

`redis-to-aerospike` is a command-line tool that copies data from **Redis** (or
**Valkey** and other **Redis-compatible** servers using the same protocol) into
**Aerospike**, converting each Redis value into a **native Aerospike type** as it
goes. It streams keys out of Redis with `SCAN` and writes them with a pool of
worker threads, so it stays fast and memory-bounded even on large keyspaces.

The data model stays key-value to key-value: a Redis key becomes an Aerospike
record ``(namespace, set, primary_key)``, and its value becomes a native type. With
**set routes**, ``set`` and often ``primary_key`` are derived from the route pattern
(see [Transferring data](docs/04-transferring-data.md)); otherwise ``primary_key``
is the full Redis key and ``set`` comes from ``--aerospike-set``.

## Main features

- **Native Aerospike types** — Migrates Redis strings, hashes, lists, sets, and
  sorted sets (plus TTLs) into appropriate bins, lists, and maps; unsupported types
  (e.g. Streams) are skipped and counted in the summary.
- **Multithreaded pipeline** — A producer streams `SCAN` results into a **bounded
  queue**; a pool of **worker threads** (default 8, `--workers`) converts and writes
  in parallel so the run stays fast without loading the whole keyspace into memory.
- **Key placement** — Narrow the source with Redis `SCAN` `MATCH`
  (`redis.scan_match`, `--redis-match`); optionally map key patterns to Aerospike
  sets (and shorter user keys) with `set_routes` / `--set-route`. See
  [Transferring data](docs/04-transferring-data.md).
- **Flexible configuration** — **CLI**, **YAML** (`--config`), and **environment
  variables**; any CLI flag you pass overrides the matching YAML value
  ([Configuration reference](docs/07-configuration-reference.md)).
- **Serious connectivity** — Redis or Valkey standalone or **Cluster**, **TLS** / mutual TLS,
  **ACL** auth, and connection **URLs**; Aerospike **multi-host**, Enterprise **auth**
  modes, **TLS** / mutual TLS, and client timeouts ([Redis](docs/02-connecting-redis.md),
  [Aerospike](docs/03-connecting-aerospike.md)).
- **Tuning and safety** — Scan and write **rate limits**, **batch** writes to
  Aerospike, hash layout strategies, **TTL overflow** policies, dry-run **preview**,
  namespace checks, progress **heartbeat**, and a final **summary** (throughput,
  skips, errors) with meaningful **exit codes** ([Running and tuning](docs/05-running-and-tuning.md)).

## Type mapping

| Redis type | Aerospike representation |
| --- | --- |
| String | Single bin, coerced to `int` -> `float` -> `str` -> `bytes` (blob). |
| Hash | One **key-ordered** Map bin (default, `MAP_KEY_ORDERED`), or one bin per field (`--hash-strategy field_bins`). |
| List | Aerospike List (order preserved). |
| Set | Aerospike List written with the `ADD_UNIQUE` flag (ordered), enforcing set semantics. |
| Sorted Set | **Key-ordered** Aerospike Map (`MAP_KEY_ORDERED`) of `{member: score}`. |
| TTL | Redis ms TTL -> Aerospike second TTL; no expiry -> never-expire. |

Only these types are migrated; other types (e.g. Streams) are skipped and counted in
the run summary. See [Transferring data](docs/04-transferring-data.md) for details,
including TTL boundary handling, large-record limits, **Redis SCAN filtering**
(`scan_match`), and **per-pattern Aerospike set routing** (`set_routes`).

## Key placement

- **Narrow what Redis returns:** `redis.scan_match` in YAML, or `--redis-match` /
  `--redis-key-pattern` on the CLI (Redis `SCAN` `MATCH` only).
- **Choose the Aerospike set (and optional key suffix) per pattern:**
  `aerospike.set_routes` in YAML, or repeatable `--set-route PATTERN=SET` (first match
  wins; a single `*` in the pattern strips fixed literals from the Aerospike user
  key—see docs).

See [Transferring data](docs/04-transferring-data.md) for details and limitations.

## Install

Requires **Python 3.10+**.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install redis-to-aerospike
```

Verify it installed:

```bash
redis-to-aerospike --help
```

### Develop from source

From a clone of this repository, install in editable mode with the dev extras
(tests and local tooling):

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for running the test suite and opening pull requests.
The [getting started guide](docs/01-getting-started.md) also mentions this install path.

## Quick start

Start throwaway local Redis and Aerospike services (no auth/TLS):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Preview what would happen, without writing anything:

```bash
redis-to-aerospike \
  --redis-host localhost --redis-port 6379 \
  --aerospike-host localhost --aerospike-port 3000 \
  --aerospike-namespace test --aerospike-set redis \
  --dry-run
```

Run the migration:

```bash
redis-to-aerospike \
  --redis-host localhost --redis-port 6379 \
  --aerospike-host localhost --aerospike-port 3000 \
  --aerospike-namespace test --aerospike-set redis \
  --workers 8
```

Every flag has a sensible default; run `redis-to-aerospike --help` for the full
list.

### Sample data for migration tests

The script [`scripts/sample_redis_seed.py`](scripts/sample_redis_seed.py) loads
**10,000** keys (by default) across all supported Redis types—string, hash, list,
set, and sorted set—with mixed values and some expiring strings. Keys are prefixed
with `sample:migrate:`.

[`scripts/sample_redis_seed_routing.py`](scripts/sample_redis_seed_routing.py) seeds
**`sample:route:`** keys (`user:*`, `session:*`, `cache:*`, `ledger:*`) for
**`--set-route`** / `set_routes` demos. **Default is at least 10,000 keys**
(`--count`); use `--per-route N` for a smaller fixed layout. With the example routes,
Aerospike user keys are the short suffix after each prefix (e.g. ``7`` in set
``users``, not the full Redis key). See the script’s docstring for example CLI and
YAML.

```bash
python scripts/sample_redis_seed.py              # default localhost:6379, 10k keys
python scripts/sample_redis_seed.py --flush      # FLUSHDB first, then seed
python scripts/sample_redis_seed.py --count 5000 --host redis.example.com

python scripts/sample_redis_seed_routing.py --flush           # default: ≥10k keys
python scripts/sample_redis_seed_routing.py --count 50000 --flush
python scripts/sample_redis_seed_routing.py --per-route 50   # small fixed layout (262 keys)
```

Then run `redis-to-aerospike` with the same Redis host/port against your Aerospike
namespace.

## Configuring the tool

You can configure the tool three ways, and mix them:

- **CLI flags** -- e.g. `--redis-host`, `--workers`. Best for one-off runs.
- **A YAML file** -- pass it with `--config myconfig.yaml`. The YAML is the base;
  any CLI flag you also pass overrides the matching value. See
  [`config.example.yaml`](config.example.yaml) for an annotated template.
- **Environment variables** -- `REDIS_*`, `AEROSPIKE_*`, `MIGRATION_*`. Best for
  secrets and containers.

Some advanced Redis options (ACL username, connection URL, Cluster, TLS) are only
available via YAML or environment variables, not CLI flags. The
[configuration reference](docs/07-configuration-reference.md) lists every option
with its flag, YAML key, env var, and default.

### Connecting securely

The tool supports Redis ACL auth, TLS, connection URLs, and Redis Cluster (and
the same client options against Valkey where applicable), and
Aerospike Enterprise security with auth, TLS/mutual TLS, and tuned timeouts.
Passwords are never printed. See:

- [Connecting to Redis](docs/02-connecting-redis.md)
- [Connecting to Aerospike](docs/03-connecting-aerospike.md)

## Reading the output

A run prints, in order:

1. **Preview** -- a summary of both sides and the pipeline settings, before any write.
   `--dry-run` stops here.
2. **Checks** -- warnings based on the Aerospike namespace settings (e.g. TTL eviction
   disabled).
3. **Delimiter** -- the same three-line banner (`redis-to-aerospike: migration` between
   rule lines) is logged **twice**: once right before records are read and written,
   and once right after the write phase finishes (before the summary), so you can spot
   the migration window in a long log file.
4. **Progress** -- a compact heartbeat line every `--progress-interval` seconds.
5. **Summary** -- final counters (scanned, migrated, skipped, errors), timing, throughput,
   and skip/error breakdowns.

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` completed with errors, `2` could not connect. See
[Running and tuning](docs/05-running-and-tuning.md) and
[Troubleshooting](docs/06-troubleshooting.md) for more.
